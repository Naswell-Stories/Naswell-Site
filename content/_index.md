## Welcome to Naswell

You’ve done a lot of thinking.  
Now it’s time to **live a story you’re proud of.**

Naswell is where coaching, storytelling, and honest conversation meet.  
I help you:

- untangle what’s going on in your head,
- make decisions you can stand behind,
- and turn your next chapter into intentional, confident action.

---

### What I do

- **1:1 Coaching** – structured, practical sessions grounded in empathy and accountability.  
- **Story-Driven Reflection** – we use your own life stories to find patterns, strengths, and blind spots.  
- **Gentle but Direct Guidance** – no fake positivity, no harsh judgment. Just clear, respectful truth.

---

### Who Naswell is for

- People who feel “stuck between chapters” – not broken, but not where they want to be.  
- High-functioning overthinkers who are good at helping others but harsh on themselves.  
- Anyone who wants emotional clarity *and* concrete steps, not just theories.
