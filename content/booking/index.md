# Free Coaching Sessions - Limited Time Offer

**Struggling to navigate life after COVID? You're not alone.**

I'm Nasir, and I'm offering **FREE 1-on-1 coaching sessions** to the first 15 young adults who feel stuck, uncertain, or lost in this post-COVID world.

**This is not a sales call. This is real coaching—completely free.**

**🎯 4-6 Weekly Coaching Sessions**  
Every session is 60 minutes of focused, personalized coaching designed around YOUR specific challenges and goals.

**💬 Bilingual Support (Arabic/English)**  
Speak in whichever language feels most comfortable. Switch between both if you want—I'm fluent in both.

**📱 WhatsApp Support Between Sessions**  
Stuck or need quick guidance between sessions? Message me on WhatsApp and I'll respond within 24 hours.

**📖 The Storytelling Method**  
My unique approach uses stories and narrative to help you understand your journey and create meaningful change.

## Why Am I Offering This for Free?

I'm building my coaching practice, and I want to help young adults like you who are navigating the unique challenges of our post-COVID world.

In exchange for free coaching, I only ask three things:

✅ **Be committed** - Show up to sessions and do the work  
✅ **Give honest feedback** - Help me improve my coaching  
✅ **Share your success** - If you see results, record a short video testimonial and tell friends who might benefit
