Free Coaching Sessions - Limited Time Offer
Struggling to navigate life after COVID? You're not alone.
I'm Nasir, and I'm offering FREE 1-on-1 coaching sessions to the first 15 young adults who feel stuck, uncertain, or lost in this post-COVID world.
This is not a sales call. This is real coaching—completely free.

What You'll Get
🎯 4-6 Weekly Coaching Sessions
Every session is 60 minutes of focused, personalized coaching designed around YOUR specific challenges and goals.
💬 Bilingual Support (Arabic/English)
Speak in whichever language feels most comfortable. Switch between both if you want—I'm fluent in both.
📱 WhatsApp Support Between Sessions
Stuck or need quick guidance between sessions? Message me on WhatsApp and I'll respond within 24 hours.
📖 The Storytelling Method
My unique approach uses stories and narrative to help you understand your journey and create meaningful change.

Why Am I Offering This for Free?
I'm building my coaching practice, and I want to help young adults like you who are navigating the unique challenges of our post-COVID world.
In exchange for free coaching, I only ask three things:
✅ Be committed - Show up to sessions and do the work
✅ Give honest feedback - Help me improve my coaching
✅ Share your success - If you see results, record a short video testimonial and tell friends who might benefit

Who Is This For?
This coaching is perfect for you if:

You're a young adult (18-35) feeling lost or stuck after COVID
You're struggling with direction, purpose, or motivation
You want to improve your relationships or social connections
You're dealing with anxiety, uncertainty, or low confidence
You're ready to make real changes in your life
You can commit to 4-6 weekly sessions


Who Is This NOT For?
Please don't book if:

You're looking for therapy or medical treatment (I'm a coach, not a therapist)
You're not willing to do the work between sessions
You just want free advice without commitment
You're dealing with severe mental health issues (please seek professional help)


How It Works
Step 1: Click the WhatsApp button below and send me a message
Step 2: I'll ask you a few questions about your situation and goals
Step 3: We'll schedule your first 60-minute session (online via Zoom/Google Meet)
Step 4: We'll meet weekly for 4-6 sessions to work on your specific challenges
Step 5: At the end, I'll ask for your feedback and (if you've seen results) a testimonial

Frequently Asked Questions
How long does each session last?
Each session is 60 minutes.
How many sessions will I get?
Between 4-6 sessions, depending on your needs and progress. We'll meet weekly.
Is this really free?
Yes, completely free. No hidden costs, no upsells during the sessions.
What happens after the 6 sessions?
Nothing! You're free to go. If you want to continue coaching after that, I'll be launching paid services in February 2025, and I'll offer you a special alumni rate.
Do I need to prepare anything?
Just come with an open mind and be ready to talk about your challenges and goals. I'll send you a short questionnaire before our first session.
What if I can't make a session?
Just let me know at least 24 hours in advance, and we'll reschedule. If you no-show twice without notice, your spot will be given to someone else.
Will my information be private?
Absolutely. Everything we discuss is confidential. If I use your story as an example (with your permission), it will be completely anonymized.
What if I'm not comfortable on video?
We can do audio-only calls if you prefer. Whatever makes you most comfortable.
