## Coaching with Naswell

My style is:

- **Warm but honest** – I will not attack you, and I will not lie to you.  
- **Structured** – clear goals, notes, and follow-ups.  
- **Story-driven** – we look at concrete situations from your life, not theory.

### Focus areas

- Confidence and self-respect  
- Boundaries and difficult conversations  
- Life transitions and “stuck” phases  
- Building a life rhythm you can actually sustain
