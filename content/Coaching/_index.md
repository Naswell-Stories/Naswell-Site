## Coaching with Naswell

This is not “fix yourself quickly” coaching.

We work with three pillars:

1. **Story** – What have you been telling yourself about who you are?  
2. **Structure** – What does your day, week, and environment actually look like?  
3. **Self-respect** – Where are you shrinking, people-pleasing, or abandoning yourself?

### How sessions work

- 1:1 online sessions (video or audio).
- You bring one real situation: work, relationships, identity, confidence.
- We unpack it, name what’s really going on, and design one or two **concrete moves**.
